        <h2><br><br><br>Game Basics</h2>
        <p>Dive into the world of Kuso as you fight your way towards the freedom you crave in this intense action shooter. 
            At war with your sanity, to survive you must fight against your greater self and escape the personal hell you were sentenced to.</p>
        <h2>Platform/Controls</h2>
        <p>Control with WASD and Space as you interact with objects and attack enemies. 
            The tutorial will be integrated into the game, and to beat the game all you need to do is be skilled at the basic controls given. 
            The game will be playable on desktop only.</p>
