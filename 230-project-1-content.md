# Kuso

## Held as a political prisoner, the powers above banish you to Kuso, a mental prison held in the darkest region of your mind.

### Dive into the world of Kuso as you fight your way towards the freedom you crave in this intense action shooter.
### At war with your sanity, to survive you must fight against your greater self and escape the personal hell you were sentenced to.

### Kuso has an abstract graphics style. The background audio will be minimal but there will be sounds attached to player and enemy actions.

#### The player controls with WASD and Space, and can interact with objects and attack enemies. 
#### The tutorial will be integrated into the game, and to beat the game all you need to do is be skilled at the basic controls given.
#### The game will be playable on desktop only.
